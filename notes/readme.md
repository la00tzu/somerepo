there is no secret. The human titan amongst men is a mired, old and tired worker, who for many moons have slaved to realize what is really a half-remembered dream. Or it could be a dangerous man who realizes dreams while they are awake. People gravitate towards these kinds of people for inspiration , yes mostly for inspiration , while they themselves are stumbling through the dark chasing dreams in the mist. The human titan is in synch with an idea that is made concrete through a lot of hard times and hours and sometimes had the blurred line between reality and imagination. Somehow they had that state of not giving a single pause for when they had already left the edge of the abyss, already falling , but holding to a reality already built. They cross that line without thinking of the difference between the sides of it. All they know is that reality and their imagination is one and the same.
